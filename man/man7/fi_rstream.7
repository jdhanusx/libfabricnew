.SH OVERVIEW
.PP

It maps stream to message over a core RMA\-based OFI provider.
Only Endpoints and EQs are needed for connection start\-up and
messaging.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES

The rstream provider currently supports \f[I]FI_MSG\f[] capabilities.
.TP
.B \f[I]Endpoint types\f[]
The provider supports only endpoint type \f[I]FI_EP_SOCK_STREAM\f[].

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The rstream provider is experimental and lacks performance validation
and extensive testing.
Currently the rstream provider is used to by the rsockets\-OFI library
as a ULP and hooks into the core provider verbs.
There are default settings that limit the message stream (provider
memory region size and CQ size).
These can be modified by fi_setopt.
.SH SETTINGS
.PP
The \f[I]rstream\f[] provider settings can be modified via fi_setopt on
the endpoint (FI_OPT_ENDPOINT) along with the following parameters:
.TP

Size of the send buffer.
Default is 32KB.
